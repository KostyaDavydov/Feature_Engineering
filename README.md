# Feature_Engineering
In this project we will dive into Feature Engineering and understand the importance of this process.

Feature Engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the performance of a machine-learning model. It involves selecting relevant information from raw data and transforming it into a format that can be easily understood by a model.

In this project we apply Feature Engineering to a binary classification task.

By condition, we have data where there are objects of two classes with labels "A" and "B". We need to create a model based on a Logistic Regression algorithm that will give us 100% correct answers.
